Welcome to the ZambiaStays Organisation

ZambiaStays is a modern booking and property management platform tailored for the Zambian hospitality industry — including lodges, hotels, guesthouses, furnished apartments, and event venues. Our goal is to bring world-class reservation technology to local operators while offering travellers a seamless digital booking experience.
